        <h1>Sabatron</h1>
        
        <p>Sabatron with his superpowers tries to detect evil people and kill them ruthlessly.His spinning green aura works just like a sonar on a ship. It sends good energy and when it bends on an evil person it sends a signal back to him so he can easily locate them. His head grows bigger to fit his hard processing brain that helps him compute all the evil information of the world.</p>
